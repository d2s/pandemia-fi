## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
Read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/dajxyz/pandemia-fi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand what is needed at the moment.

We are looking for contributors, especially those who can bring data to life with interactive visualisations. We are tracking multiple domestic and global data sources to bring a sense of the COVID-19 crisis to our readers and have a large volunteer research team to provide ideas, compile data from primary sources and help estimate realistic clinical parameters for models. The new web app itself will be fully open-source and it is being built using React, Rebass, and Apex Charts. Other tools are welcome as well! Currently we have a small group of core contributors. If the above sounds interesting consider jumping aboard and having an impact!

## Project history

The collection of resources started as an internal database within Daniel Jyllikoskiâ€™s agency in January 2020.

First version of the website was built during March. Focus moved forward to publishing the collection as an interactive online resource. Team of contributors participated to the [Hack The Crisis Finland](https://www.hackthecrisisfinland.com/) hackathon event during the weekend of March 20 to March 22, 2020. Our goal during the event was to start building a completely new version of the website.

Project continues.
