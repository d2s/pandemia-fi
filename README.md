# Pandemia.fi

[Pandemia.fi](https://www.pandemia.fi/) is an information resource and a news aggregator that only an independent team of volunteer individuals could build.

We are building a completely new site as part of the [Hack The Crisis Finland](https://www.hackthecrisisfinland.com/) hackathon during the weekend of March 20 to March 22, 2020.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! The new code lives under the `pandemia-fi` directory
and is a basic `create-react-app` setup. Feel free to post issues and even bake a PR!

### We are especially looking for contributions towards

- React app internationalisation.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (either directly or via a tool like nvm or similar)
